The PCB Design comprises of the following main components :

* The FD6288 is an integrated three-phase half-bridge gate driver IC designed for high-voltage,high-speed driving of MOSFETs.
** The nRF52840-QIAA-R is a Bluetooth 5.0 SoC (System-on-Chip) from Nordic Semiconductor designed for low-power wireless communication
*** Sense pins in an Electronic Speed Controller (ESC) are used to monitor motor parameters such as current, voltage, or speed.
**** The DW01-A is a lithium-ion battery protection IC designed to safeguard rechargeable lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries from overcharge, over-discharge, and overcurrent conditions.
***** The HY2213-BB3A is a 1-cell Li-ion/Polymer Battery Charge Balance IC developed by HYCON Technology Corporation. It's designed to ensure efficient and safe charging of single-cell lithium-ion or lithium-polymer batteries by balancing the charge and preventing overcharge conditions.
